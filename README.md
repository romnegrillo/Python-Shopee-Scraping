# Python Shopee Scraping

### About
This repository contains Python automation programs to web scrape shopee.ph 
and gather information about the items you purchased in your Shopee account. 

As of now, it allows you to enter username/email, password, and OTP sent
from your phone using the command line. Then it will generate a PDF
file summarizing all the items you purchased in your whole history list,
which includes the item's name and price in a tabular format.

Warning: Using it multiple times consecutively will block your account 
by a certain minutes. This is a security feature in Shopee when you try
to send OTP too many times.

### Disclaimer
I do not save any personal info you will enter in this program. I just used
the 3rd party Python modules to automate the process. I'm not responsible for
any trouble you may face when using this script. I tested this using my own
Shopee account.
